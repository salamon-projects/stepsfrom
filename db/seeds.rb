# Launch destinations. Bounding boxes are approximate and can be adjusted in
# the admin; they only decide which OSM data `bin/rails osm:import[slug]`
# fetches. Properties come from that import, never from seeds.
#
# In development, `bin/rails db:seed` also loads a small fictional demo bay
# (db/seeds/demo.rb) so the site can be tried without an OSM import.
